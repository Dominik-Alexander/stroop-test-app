# About the Stroop Test

The Stroop Test is a psychological assessment that measures cognitive processing speed and selective attention. In this test, individuals are presented with a list of color words (e.g., red, blue, green) written in different ink colors. The challenge arises when the ink color does not match the written color word (e.g., the word "red" written in blue ink). Participants are required to name the ink color while inhibiting the automatic response to read the word. The interference between the conflicting information (word and ink color) creates a cognitive conflict, making it more difficult for individuals to accurately and quickly identify the ink color. The Stroop Test is widely used in psychology to evaluate executive functions, such as cognitive flexibility and response inhibition. Differences in performance can provide insights into various cognitive processes and are often utilized in clinical assessments and research studies.
